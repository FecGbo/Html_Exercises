        In this second edition of the book John joins Ian as a co-author. We have both had long careers in
the world of game AI, but two memories that stand out from Ian’s career provide the philosophical
underpinnings for the book.
The first memory takes place in a dingy computer lab on the top floor of the computer
science building at Birmingham University in the UK. Ian was halfway through the first year of his
Artificial Intelligence degree, and he had only been in the department for a couple of weeks after
transferring from a Mathematics major. Catching up on a semester of work was, unexpectedly,
great fun, and a great bunch of fellow students was eager to help him learn about Expert Systems,
Natural Language Processing, Philosophy of Mind, and the Prolog programming language.
One of his fellow students had written a simple text-based adventure game in Prolog. Ian
was not new to game programming—he was part of the 8-bit bedroom coding scene through his
teenage years, and by this time had written more than ten games himself. But this simple game
completely captivated him. It was the first time he’d seen a finite state machine (FSM) in action.
There was an Ogre, who could be asleep, dozing, distracted, or angry. And you could control his
emotions through hiding, playing a flute, or stealing his dinner.
All thoughts of assignment deadlines were thrown to the wind, and a day later Ian had his
own game in C written with this new technique. It was a mind-altering experience, taking him to
an entirely new understanding of what was possible. The enemies he’d always coded were stuck
following fixed paths or waited until the player came close before homing right in. In the FSM
he saw the prospect of modeling complex emotional states, triggers, and behaviors. And he knew
Game AI was what he wanted to do.
Ian’s second memory is more than ten years later. Using some technology developed to simulate
military tactics, he had founded a company called Mindlathe, dedicated to providing artificial
intelligence middleware to games and other real-time applications. It was more than two years
into development, and the company was well into the process of converting prototypes and legacy
code into a robust AI engine. Ian was working on the steering system, producing a formation
motion plug-in.
On screen he had a team of eight robots wandering through a landscape of trees. Using
techniques in this book, they stayed roughly in formation while avoiding collisions and taking
the easiest route through more difficult terrain. The idea occurred to Ian to combine this with
an existing demo they had of characters using safe tactical locations to hide in. With a few lines
of code he had the formation locked to tactical locations. Rather than robots trying to stay in a

V formation, they tried to stick to safe locations, moving forward only if they would otherwise get
left behind. Immediately the result was striking: the robots dashed between cover points, moving
one at a time, so the whole group made steady progress through the forest, but each individual
stayed in cover as long as possible.
The memory persists, not because of that idea, but because it was the fastest and most striking
example of something we will see many times in this book: that incredibly realistic results can be
gained from intelligently combining very simple algorithms.

the world of game AI, but two memories that stand out from Ian’s career provide the philosophical
underpinnings for the book.
The first memory takes place in a dingy computer lab on the top floor of the computer
science building at Birmingham University in the UK. Ian was halfway through the first year of his
Artificial Intelligence degree, and he had only been in the department for a couple of weeks after
transferring from a Mathematics major. Catching up on a semester of work was, unexpectedly,
great fun, and a great bunch of fellow students was eager to help him learn about Expert Systems,
Natural Language Processing, Philosophy of Mind, and the Prolog programming language.
One of his fellow students had written a simple text-based adventure game in Prolog. Ian
was not new to game programming—he was part of the 8-bit bedroom coding scene through his
teenage years, and by this time had written more than ten games himself. But this simple game
completely captivated him. It was the first time he’d seen a finite state machine (FSM) in action.
There was an Ogre, who could be asleep, dozing, distracted, or angry. And you could control his
emotions through hiding, playing a flute, or stealing his dinner.
All thoughts of assignment deadlines were thrown to the wind, and a day later Ian had his
own game in C written with this new technique. It was a mind-altering experience, taking him to
an entirely new understanding of what was possible. The enemies he’d always coded were stuck
following fixed paths or waited until the player came close before homing right in. In the FSM
he saw the prospect of modeling complex emotional states, triggers, and behaviors. And he knew
Game AI was what he wanted to do.
Ian’s second memory is more than ten years later. Using some technology developed to simulate
military tactics, he had founded a company called Mindlathe, dedicated to providing artificial
intelligence middleware to games and other real-time applications. It was more than two years
into development, and the company was well into the process of converting prototypes and legacy
code into a robust AI engine. Ian was working on the steering system, producing a formation
motion plug-in.
On screen he had a team of eight robots wandering through a landscape of trees. Using
techniques in this book, they stayed roughly in formation while avoiding collisions and taking
the easiest route through more difficult terrain. The idea occurred to Ian to combine this with
an existing demo they had of characters using safe tactical locations to hide in. With a few lines
of code he had the formation locked to tactical locations. Rather than robots trying to stay in a

V formation, they tried to stick to safe locations, moving forward only if they would otherwise get
left behind. Immediately the result was striking: the robots dashed between cover points, moving
one at a time, so the whole group made steady progress through the forest, but each individual
stayed in cover as long as possible.
The memory persists, not because of that idea, but because it was the fastest and most striking
example of something we will see many times in this book: that incredibly realistic results can be
gained from intelligently combining very simple algorithms.

great fun, and a great bunch of fellow students was eager to help him learn about Expert Systems,
Natural Language Processing, Philosophy of Mind, and the Prolog programming language.
One of his fellow students had written a simple text-based adventure game in Prolog. Ian
was not new to game programming—he was part of the 8-bit bedroom coding scene through his
teenage years, and by this time had written more than ten games himself. But this simple game
completely captivated him. It was the first time he’d seen a finite state machine (FSM) in action.
There was an Ogre, who could be asleep, dozing, distracted, or angry. And you could control his
emotions through hiding, playing a flute, or stealing his dinner.
All thoughts of assignment deadlines were thrown to the wind, and a day later Ian had his
own game in C written with this new technique. It was a mind-altering experience, taking him to
an entirely new understanding of what was possible. The enemies he’d always coded were stuck
following fixed paths or waited until the player came close before homing right in. In the FSM
he saw the prospect of modeling complex emotional states, triggers, and behaviors. And he knew
Game AI was what he wanted to do.
Ian’s second memory is more than ten years later. Using some technology developed to simulate
military tactics, he had founded a company called Mindlathe, dedicated to providing artificial
intelligence middleware to games and other real-time applications. It was more than two years
into development, and the company was well into the process of converting prototypes and legacy
code into a robust AI engine. Ian was working on the steering system, producing a formation
motion plug-in.
On screen he had a team of eight robots wandering through a landscape of trees. Using
techniques in this book, they stayed roughly in formation while avoiding collisions and taking
the easiest route through more difficult terrain. The idea occurred to Ian to combine this with
an existing demo they had of characters using safe tactical locations to hide in. With a few lines
of code he had the formation locked to tactical locations. Rather than robots trying to stay in a

completely captivated him. It was the first time he’d seen a finite state machine (FSM) in action.
There was an Ogre, who could be asleep, dozing, distracted, or angry. And you could control his
emotions through hiding, playing a flute, or stealing his dinner.
All thoughts of assignment deadlines were thrown to the wind, and a day later Ian had his
own game in C written with this new technique. It was a mind-altering experience, taking him to
an entirely new understanding of what was possible. The enemies he’d always coded were stuck
following fixed paths or waited until the player came close before homing right in. In the FSM
he saw the prospect of modeling complex emotional states, triggers, and behaviors. And he knew
Game AI was what he wanted to do.
Ian’s second memory is more than ten years later. Using some technology developed to simulate
military tactics, he had founded a company called Mindlathe, dedicated to providing artificial
intelligence middleware to games and other real-time applications. It was more than two years
into development, and the company was well into the process of converting prototypes and legacy
code into a robust AI engine. Ian was working on the steering system, producing a formation
motion plug-in.
On screen he had a team of eight robots wandering through a landscape of trees. Using
techniques in this book, they stayed roughly in formation while avoiding collisions and taking
the easiest route through more difficult terrain. The idea occurred to Ian to combine this with
an existing demo they had of characters using safe tactical locations to hide in. With a few lines
of code he had the formation locked to tactical locations. Rather than robots trying to stay in a

Ian’s second memory is more than ten years later. Using some technology developed to simulate
military tactics, he had founded a company called Mindlathe, dedicated to providing artificial
intelligence middleware to games and other real-time applications. It was more than two years

code into a robust AI engine. Ian was working on the steering system, producing a formation
motion plug-in.
On screen he had a team of eight robots wandering through a landscape of trees. Using
techniques in this book, they stayed roughly in formation while avoiding collisions and taking
the easiest route through more difficult terrain. The idea occurred to Ian to combine this with

of code he had the formation locked to tactical locations. Rather than robots trying to stay in a

In this second edition of the book John joins Ian as a co-author. We have both had long careers in
the world of game AI, but two memories that stand out from Ian’s career provide the philosophical
underpinnings for the book.
The first memory takes place in a dingy computer lab on the top floor of the computer
science building at Birmingham University in the UK. Ian was halfway through the first year of his
Artificial Intelligence degree, and he had only been in the department for a couple of weeks after
transferring from a Mathematics major. Catching up on a semester of work was, unexpectedly,
great fun, and a great bunch of fellow students was eager to help him learn about Expert Systems,
Natural Language Processing, Philosophy of Mind, and the Prolog programming language.
One of his fellow students had written a simple text-based adventure game in Prolog. Ian
was not new to game programming—he was part of the 8-bit bedroom coding scene through his
teenage years, and by this time had written more than ten games himself. But this simple game
completely captivated him. It was the first time he’d seen a finite state machine (FSM) in action.
There was an Ogre, who could be asleep, dozing, distracted, or angry. And you could control his
emotions through hiding, playing a flute, or stealing his dinner.
All thoughts of assignment deadlines were thrown to the wind, and a day later Ian had his
own game in C written with this new technique. It was a mind-altering experience, taking him to
an entirely new understanding of what was possible. The enemies he’d always coded were stuck
following fixed paths or waited until the player came close before homing right in. In the FSM
he saw the prospect of modeling complex emotional states, triggers, and behaviors. And he knew
